perl-total-connect-comfort
==========================

A Perl module that wraps the [Honeywell Total Connect Comfort][htcc] API. Allows you to query room temperatures and view other details like setpoints.

[htcc]: https://infoeu.mytotalconnectcomfort.com/gb

## Usage

Call the test script with ./test_api.pl *username* *password* (don't forget to single quote that password if it contains symbols).

## Cacti

Also includes Cacti scripts and templates to make setting up Cacti monitoring simple.

I've written a [Cacti setup guide](http://will.dollman.org/2014/10/03/totalconnectcomfort-and-cacti-setup-guide/) (because sadly it's not *that* simple).
